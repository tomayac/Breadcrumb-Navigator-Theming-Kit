The [Breadcrumb Navigator Theming Kit](http://tomayac.github.io/Breadcrumb-Navigator-Theming-Kit/)
is intended for users of the Google Chrome
Breadcrumb Navigator extension [1] who want to create their own themes. There
are two files in this repo:

* `index.html`:
  Contains a static representation of both Breadcrumb Navigator navigation
  styles. Only needed to check the styles defined in the accompanying
  stylesheet.
* `styles_bgcolor_fgcolor.css`:
  Contains the CSS styles and CSS classes needed for both Breadcrumb Navigator
  navigation styles. You only need to edit this file.

If you're done with your theme, send me (steiner.thomasREMOVE_THIS@gmail.com)
the CSS file and I can include your theme in the next release of the
[extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hphdahmligbkhjoedbpeoigbmopehdhm).
